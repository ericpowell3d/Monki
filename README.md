### Description
Project creating an all around application based on user inputed music artists and locations of venues. Geared to be user inactive and provide information about the when and where of up and coming shows. Application supplies basic information about the artists and the venues, also a link to the artists page on Spotify for even more extensive information if they so choose to use it. 

Inquiries about artists will provide an image, top tracks widget, upcoming tour dates and shows, along with the related links. Inquires about the location will also take into account the artists being searched for, looking up specific locations on a user interactive map. Also has functionality to search local venues, based on the user's location or an inputed location.
